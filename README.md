## Image Encryption Tool Using Pixel Manipulation

### Description
The Image Encryption Tool is a Python application that employs pixel manipulation techniques to encrypt and decrypt images. By swapping pixel values and applying basic mathematical operations, this tool provides a unique approach to image security.

### Overview
Images are critical forms of data that require protection against unauthorized access. This project enhances image security through simple yet effective encryption methods, allowing users to securely encrypt their images and decrypt them back to their original form.

### Features
- Pixel Swapping: Randomly swaps pixel values for basic encryption.
- Mathematical Operations: Applies arithmetic operations on pixel values for added complexity.
- Encryption and Decryption: Supports both operations, allowing users to revert to the original image.

### Installation
#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pillow (Python Imaging Library)

#### Running the Application
Clone the repository or download the source code.

Ensure that Python is installed on your system.

Run the following command in your terminal to start the application:
```bash
python image_encryption_tool.py
```

### How to Use
1. **Start the Application**: Run the script to launch the Image Encryption Tool.
2. **Upload Image**: Select the image you wish to encrypt.
3. **Perform Encryption/Decryption**: Choose the appropriate function and save the output.

### Key Components
- **Pixel Manipulation Functions**: Functions that handle pixel value swapping and arithmetic operations.
- **Image Handling**: Logic to read and write image files using the Pillow library.
